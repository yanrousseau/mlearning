Dear graders,

I have created a gh-pages branch as requested. However, the .html document is not interpreted and show html code instead. I apologize about this. I have tried making it work for 4 hours and just decided to quit trying. The submission process has just taken me as much time as the creation of the R script. Please let me know if you are aware of the steps required to create a gh-pages branch.

Meanwhile, I would appreciate if you could download the .html file on your computer and open it in a browser for marking it.

Thank you in advance for understanding.

Yannick
